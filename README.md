# alexandria-scribe

alexandria-scribe is a semantic preservation engine for human thought.

It ingests raw intellectual artifacts—documents, conversations, threads—and decomposes them into idea fragments that accrete meaning over time.

This system is not a note-taking tool.
It is not a document manager.
It is not a static knowledge graph.

It exists to preserve the build: the gradual, imperfect, redundant, human process of thinking—while detecting novelty, refinement, and emergence across time.

alexandria-scribe is personal-first by design, with explicit architectural seams for future multi-author and AI collaboration.
